# sudoku

Adding my project that I had done in 2016. Had forgot about it but since people don't give you job without any project so I have decided to add this to my portfolio. This project was made using BlueJ but now it is switched to use gradle. A web version will also be build using React.

## About

This project is a sudoku solver. It uses the famous and classic backtracking solution.

This is a free project.
